# Senior Project — OCII Website Spoofing

## Objective

The goal of this capstone project was to design and implement an educational framework that teaches spoof detection using hands-on, simulated cyberattacks.
The project aimed to raise cybersecurity awareness among high school students by demonstrating how spoofed login pages can be used to deceive users in a safe, controlled learning environment.

The final product included a realistic spoofed school login website, contained within secure virtual machines, capable of logging simulated credentials for post-exercise analysis.

## Project Overview

The OCII Website Spoofing project was developed as a senior capstone to create a **safe, hands-on simulation** for teaching high school students how to detect spoofed login pages. The system used virtual machines, web development tools, and secure scripting to simulate real phishing scenarios in a controlled environment.

### Bash Script

Automated deployment and management of the virtual environment, including hosting and logging of simulated credential entries.

### Flask Application

A lightweight Flask backend securely handled simulated login data and supported controlled phishing exercises.

### Official Website Page

Displayed educational material and ethical disclaimers to differentiate legitimate and spoofed sites.

## Problem Addressed

Spoofing attacks are a leading cause of cybersecurity incidents in educational institutions. Many students lack the practical experience to recognize deceptive websites and phishing attempts.
This project addresses that gap by creating a controlled, hands-on educational simulation that allows students to engage with spoofed content and learn detection strategies safely.

## Outcomes

* Successfully developed a functioning spoofed website demonstrating realistic phishing behavior
* Delivered a lightweight, open-source prototype deployable in educational environments
* Expanded cybersecurity education resources for school settings
---

## Limitations

* Ethical restrictions prevented large-scale deployment involving real student data
* Hardware limitations impacted large classroom scalability
* No longitudinal follow-up on user learning outcomes
---

## What I Learned

* Phishing simulations for educational use
* Privacy-preserving logging and compliance
* How to build secure, modular prototypes in sandboxed environments
* Effective team coordination and client communication in a development project
