# CYB-4003 Project 04 — OCII Website Spoofing

## Objective

The goal of this capstone project was to design and implement an educational framework that teaches spoof detection using hands-on, simulated cyberattacks.
The project aimed to raise cybersecurity awareness among high school students by demonstrating how spoofed login pages can be used to deceive users in a safe, controlled learning environment.

The final product included a realistic spoofed school login website, contained within secure virtual machines, capable of logging simulated credentials for post-exercise analysis.

## Skills Learned

* Designing and developing realistic phishing and spoofing simulations
* Implementing **secure logging mechanisms** for simulated data
* Configuring and deploying **virtual machine environments** for isolated testing
* Applying **ethical and legal cybersecurity standards** to educational simulations
* Conducting **threat modeling** and **user awareness analysis**
* Collaborating in a **team-based capstone project** to meet client-defined requirements

---

## Tools Used

* HTML / CSS (frontend design for spoofed login page)
* Lightweight backend scripting (Python / Flask for logging prototype)
* VirtualBox and VMware (virtual machine sandboxing)
* GitHub (version control and collaboration)
* VS Code (development environment)

### Core Components

| Component                   | Description                                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Spoofed Login Page**      | Designed a realistic imitation of a school login interface to simulate phishing behavior.       |
| **Secure Logging System**   | Captured simulated login attempts for instructional feedback without storing real credentials.  |
| **Virtualized Environment** | Deployed all components in isolated virtual machines to ensure safety and control.              |
| **Educational Exercises**   | Students interacted with spoofed pages and later reviewed logged results to identify red flags. |
| **Scalability Options**     | Designed architecture to support multiple difficulty levels for varied user experience.         |

## Problem Addressed

Spoofing attacks are a leading cause of cybersecurity incidents in educational institutions. Many students lack the practical experience to recognize deceptive websites and phishing attempts.
This project addresses that gap by creating a controlled, hands-on educational simulation that allows students to engage with spoofed content and learn detection strategies safely.

## Outcomes

* Successfully developed a functioning spoofed website demonstrating realistic phishing behavior
* Delivered a lightweight, open-source prototype deployable in educational environments
* Expanded cybersecurity education resources for school settings
---

## Limitations

* Ethical restrictions prevented large-scale deployment involving real student data
* Hardware limitations impacted large classroom scalability
* No longitudinal follow-up on user learning outcomes
---

## What I Learned

* Phishing simulations for educational use
* Privacy-preserving logging and compliance
* How to build secure, modular prototypes in sandboxed environments
* Effective team coordination and client communication in a development project
